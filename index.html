      Hello! I am currently a graduate student at California State University - Fullerton studying Computer Science and looking to pursue a career in software development within the aerospace industry.
      I received a BSBA with a concentration in Computer Information Systems from Saint Louis University where I began learning software development during my free time. 
      Some languages I picked up along the way: Python, C/C++, and Java.
      Some languages I am currently learning: Javascript and Rust.
      My current and past projects can be found under the Projects page with a link to their source codes on Github. To get in touch with me, please see visit the Contact page and I will get back to you fairly quickly.
      I enjoy playing soccer in my free time! I am an Arsenal fan! COYG!
